This project attempted to achieve the paper **[A novel GAN-based network for unmasking of 
masked face](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9019697)**. The model 
is designed to remove the face-mask from facial image and inpaint the left-behind region based 
on a novel GAN-network approach.
